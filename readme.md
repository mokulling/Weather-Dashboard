# Weather Dashboard
This project allows for users to search several cities around the globe and get the 5 day forecast for those cities. The app will also save the user's previous searches, and you can click into each previous search to have that forecast come up again.

This project was fun to work on because it allowed a lot of exposure to third party APIs and it shows you waht can be done with all sorts of outside data.
